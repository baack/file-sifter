.SH NAME
.PP
fsift \- File Sifter: Powerful tool to scan, compute digests and compare
files.
Files can be scanned in directory trees or loaded from previously saved
results.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]fsift\f[] [ \f[I]options\f[] ] [ \f[I]left\-roots\f[]...
] [ \f[B]:\f[] \f[I]right\-roots\f[]...
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
File Sifter is a utility that has features inspired by the *NIX
utilities \f[I]find\f[] and \f[I]diff\f[], as well as file digest
programs such as \f[I]sha256sum\f[].
It can be used for a variety of tasks involving the management of large
numbers of files, such as determining which files may be out\-of\-date
in off\-site backups.
.SH OVERVIEW
.PP
File Sifter able to scan file systems like \f[I]find\f[], but instead of
immediately printing entries, it loads the information into an internal
index.
.PP
Once loaded, File Sifter performs analysis on the index.
It then optionally sorts the entries and prints them out in tabular
format, followed by summary statistics.
This output may be saved to an \f[I]FSIFT\f[] file, and entries from
that file may be loaded during a later run for comparisons or similar
analysis.
.PP
The non\-option arguments given to File Sifter are called
\f[I]roots\f[].
Roots are generally either the top of a directory tree to scan, or a
previously saved \f[I]FSIFT\f[] file.
Each root is loaded into one of two \f[I]sides\f[] of the index, which
are called \f[I]left\f[] and \f[I]right\f[].
During analysis, File Sifter can compare the contents of the left and
right sides of the index based on user\-specified criteria, and it can
generate output and reports about the comparisons.
Multiple roots may be specified for each side.
.PP
File entries may be subjected to user\-defined filters at two points:
before loading into the index, or before the final output.
These filters allow tailoring the analysis to specific requirements.
.PP
Each class of information about a file processed by the program is
called a \f[I]column\f[].
Columns are defined for the usual file system attributes such as path,
size and permissions.
There are also columns for digests of file data.
Finally, some columns can by added by the File Sifter program as the
result of analysis, such as whether the file \f[I]matches\f[] at least
one other file belonging to the opposite side of the index.
.PP
Columns are only computed and stored if they are made necessary by the
user\-specified command line options.
For example, the contents of files are only read if the user specifies
operations on a digest column.

.SH OPTIONS
.PP
Options may be freely intermixed with roots.
Most options have both a long version and a short version.
Short boolean options may be concatenated (such as \-qS), and short
options which take an argument may have the argument concatenated to the
option.
Long options can have the argument joined with an "\f[B]=\f[]"
character.
The following are all equivalent: \f[B]\-st\f[], \f[B]\-s t\f[],
\f[B]\-smtime\f[], \f[B]\-\-sort mtime\f[], \f[B]\-\-sort=mtime\f[],
\f[B]\-\-sort t\f[].
.TP
.B \f[B]:\f[]

assigned to the right side.

For options that take a list of columns as an argument, the columns can
be specified with a comma\-separated list of names, long or short.
If no commas are in the argument and it does not match a long name, then
the program tries assuming that the argument is a concatenation of short
name characters.
The argument must not contain whitespace.

\f[B]redunidx\f[] value is \f[B]1\f[], then only one entry per group of
equivalent files will be output on each side, so such a filter can be
used to enumerate unique values.

.SH FILTER SPECIFICATIONS
.PP
\f[I]Filters\f[] allow the rejection of file entries based on
user\-defined criteria.
.PP
Any column can be used in a filter specification.
The general filter syntax is as follows:
.PP
<\f[B]column\-name\f[]><\f[B]operator\f[]><\f[B]value\f[]>
.PP
The column name may be any long or short column identifier.
The value is an arbitrary string for comparison to an entry\[aq]s value.
There should be no whitespace between the operator and the value.
.PP
The supported operators are:
.TP
.B \f[B]=\f[]
Equals
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \f[B]< <= > >=\f[]
Ordered comparisons (numeric or lexicographic, depending on the column
type)
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \f[B]*=\f[]
Glob pattern match (see below).
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \f[B]~=\f[]
Regular expression match.
For detailed syntax, see the Go language \f[I]regexp\f[] package
documentation.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \f[B]\&.isnull\f[]
Matches if the value is missing in this file entry

.SS Combining Filters
.PP
Multiple filters of the same type may be specified.
In addition to the above filters, there are two special combining
filters:
.PP
\f[B]or\f[] Matches if either child filter matches.
.PP
\f[B]and\f[] Matches if both child filters match.
.PP
Combining filters act as binary operators between other filters.
They are applied in \f[I]prefix\f[] order (also known as \f[I]normal\f[]
Polish notation).
In other words, a combining filter appears directly in front of its two
child filters.
.PP
For example, the following set of filters selects all the files larger
than one megabyte that belong to Jack or Jill:
.PP
\f[B]\-f and \-f \[aq]size>1000000\[aq] \-f or \-f user=jack \-f
user=jill\f[]
.PP
If there are any filters of a given type remaining after combining
filters have been assigned children, then the remaining filters are
assigned to implicit \f[B]and\f[] filters.
So for the common case of multiple filters defined with no combining
filters, they are \f[I]and\f[]ed together.
.SS Glob Patterns
.PP
Glob patterns are similar to glob expansion in shell interpreters:
"\f[B]?\f[]" matches any single character except "\f[B]/\f[]".
"\f[B]*\f[]" matches any number of non\-"\f[B]/\f[]" characters.
In this implementation, the contents of brackets \f[B][\f[]...\f[B]]\f[]
are fed directly to the underlying regular expression evaluator; the
result is similar to many glob implementations, but there are some
differences.
See the Go language \f[I]regexp\f[] package documentation for details.
.PP
As a special case, a \f[B]**\f[] matches any number of characters,
\f[I]including\f[] "\f[B]/\f[]".
This can be used to match entire segments of file paths.
For example, the filter: \f[B]path*=**/.config/**\f[] will select all
files under \f[I]\&.config\f[] directories below the top level.
.PP
When using the \f[B]**\f[] operator, note that directory paths are
always stored with a trailing "\f[B]/\f[]" character.
Also note that files directly under the root will not have a
"\f[B]/\f[]" preceding them.
If this creates problems with glob matching entire paths, a regular
expression pattern may be a more flexible alternative.
.SS Pruning Filters
.PP
If an entire filter specification is prefixed with a "\f[B]/\f[]"
character, that filter becomes a \f[I]pruning\f[] filter.
This only affects the \f[B]\-\-prefilter\f[] option, and then only when
scanning file systems (not loading FSIFT files).
The combining filters \f[B]and\f[] and \f[B]or\f[] cannot be prefixed in
this way.
.PP
When a pruning filter is used, if the filter rejects a directory, then
File Sifter will not descend into that directory to scan its contents.
(By default, directories are scanned even when rejected by a prefilter
because prefilters are often looking for certain files without regard to
the properties of their parent directories.)
.PP
Example: only look in the "data" subdirectory, skipping any other
directories below the current root:
.PP
\f[B]fsift . \-\-prefilter \[aq]/path*=data/**\[aq]\f[]
.PP
By contrast, the non\-pruning version of the same filter would scan any
other subdirectories below the current root, but not load any of those
files into the index, and it could possibly take substantially more
time.
It should output the same entries, but with different statistics info:
.PP
\f[B]fsift . \-\-prefilter \[aq]path*=data/**\[aq]\f[]
.SH OTHER FEATURES
.SS FSIFT Files
.PP
The output of File Sifter may be saved to a file (an extension of
\f[B]\&.FSIFT\f[] is recommended).
If this file is later specified as a root during another run of File
Sifter, then by default entries will parsed and loaded from that file.
.PP
Note that if the header information or the file entries are suppressed
using command line options (such as \f[B]\-\-summary\f[] or
\f[B]\-\-plain\f[]), then the output will not be useful for loading
later.
.SS Syntax
.PP
\f[I]FSIFT\f[] files are text files with two kinds of lines:
\f[I]directive\f[] lines and \f[I]entry\f[] lines.
Directive lines start with a \f[B]|\f[] character.
.PP
The file starts with a \f[I]directive\f[] line identifying it as an
\f[I]FSIFT\f[] file.
After that is a group of informational header directives.
The only other directive that is relevant to parsing \f[I]FSIFT\f[]
files is the \f[B]Columns\f[] directive.
This specifies which fields are present in each \f[I]entry\f[] line.
The \f[B]Columns\f[] directive must appear before the first
\f[I]entry\f[] line.
All other \f[I]directive\f[] lines are ignored by the parser.
.PP
\f[I]Entry\f[] lines follow the header, with one \f[I]entry\f[] line per
output file entry.
These lines start with a space, and are followed by one or more fields.
The number of fields matches the number of names in the \f[B]Columns\f[]
directive, and each item is the field information from the corresponding
column name.
.PP
After the entries, a footer is output.
This contains a set of \f[I]directive\f[] lines with summary information
such as run time, file and byte counts.
.PP
In \f[I]entry\f[] lines, fields are separated by space characters.
Certain characters within a field are escaped with backslashes: spaces,
newlines, carriage returns and backslashes.
In addition, there are two special escape sequences: \f[B]\\\-\f[]
indicates a zero\-length string, and \f[B]\\~\f[] indicates a missing
value (called a \f[I]null\f[]).
These escapes are removed when \f[I]FSIFT\f[] files are parsed.
.PP
As a special exception, space characters are \f[I]not\f[] escaped in the
last column.
This is possible because the parser knows that no other fields will
follow this one before the next newline.
In the common case where \f[I]path\f[] is the last field on each line,
this makes the output look cleaner when there are spaces in file names.
(However, even in the last column, any spaces at the beginning or end of
a field are still escaped.)
.PP
When the \f[B]\-\-plain0\f[] option is specified, there is no escaping
performed, and all data is separated by ASCII \f[B]NUL\f[] characters.
Then the \f[B]\-\-json\f[] option is specified, the output is escaped
according to JSON rules.
File Sifter does not support later loading from either of these formats.
.SS Summary Statistics
.PP
At the end of the run, a footer is printed by default which summarizes
the analysis of the files.
If both left and right roots were specified, it breaks out the
statistics by left and right files.
It shows file count and total size for the files processed.
.PP
The \f[I]entry\f[] lines for directories show the cumulative size of all
the files indexed under the directory.
These cumulative sizes are not included in the summary statistics
because they would cause double\-counting.
.PP
The \f[I]Scanned\f[] line shows all of the files considered (which does
not include those files rejected by \f[B]\-\-exclude\f[] or
\f[B]\-\-regular\-only\f[]).
The \f[I]Indexed\f[] line shows all of the files that pass the
\f[I]prefilter\f[] stage and get loaded into the index.
.PP
The \f[I]Unmatched\f[] line shows all files that did not have a match on
the other side, and the \f[I]Matching\f[] line shows the files that did
have a match.
The previous two lines are only output if there were roots on both
sides.
The \f[I]Output\f[] line shows all of the files that passed the
\f[I]postfilter\f[] stage and were printed to the output (or if
\f[B]\-\-summary\f[] is specified, would have been output).

.SS Interactive Status Output
.PP
While scanning the file system, File Sifter can print temporary
interactive messages that show the current status of the scan.
This includes the initial scan phase, as well as any required digest
scan phases.
This output can be suppressed with the \f[B]\-\-quiet\f[] option.
.SS Character Encodings
.PP
All characters are processed assuming UTF\-8 encoding.
File names with characters that are not decodable as valid Unicode may
produce unexpected results.
Such characters are likely to pass through to the output unchanged, but
comparisons and analysis might have problems.
Note that in some cases, file systems can be mounted with options that
automatically translate characters which cannot be converted to Unicode
to "safe" substitute sequences.
.SS Platform Specific Differences
.PP
On all platforms, path separators are internally represented and output
as "\f[B]/\f[]", regardless of what the OS uses.
.PP
On all platforms, FSIFT files always use *NIX\-style line endings.
.PP
On Windows, the following columns do not currently get populated with
meaningful values: \f[I]uid\f[], \f[I]user\f[], \f[I]gid\f[],
\f[I]group\f[], \f[I]nlinks\f[] and \f[I]device\f[].
.PP
On windows, the \f[I]modestr\f[] column contains a simplified
approximation of permissions.
.PP
On Windows, the program is not currently able to detect the console
width and assumes a fixed value of \f[I]80\f[].
This may affect the appearance of interactive status messages.
.SH HISTORY
.PP
File Sifter is the result of a long evolution of personal utilities that
I wrote over the years to help keep track of files from various computer
systems.
.PP
The first utilities were simple Perl scripts that did a simple
scan/sort/diff on directories.
Eventually, I wrote an program in C++ that used SQLite for an internal
engine that had features somewhat similar to this implementation.
However, it was hard to use the SQL\-oriented features of that version,
and although I found it very useful and used it for many years, I was
never very happy with it.
.PP
I recently decided to pare down the program to its most useful features,
clean up the user interface, drop the embedded database, and port it to
Go.
The result of that effort is this rendition of File Sifter.
